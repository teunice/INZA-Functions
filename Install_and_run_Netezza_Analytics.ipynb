    "## The IBM Netezza Analytics (INZA) enable advanced analytics in Netezza (NPS) systems\n",
    "### These functions are accessble via SQL calls and leverage the power of NPS through in-database analytics\n",
    "### This notebook uses python to issue the SQL calls, however all analytics are executed in NPS\n",
    "### Executing in NPS has numerous benefits\n",
    "### - reduces need for large analyics systems to support Jupyter notebooks or python systems \n",
    "### - nearly eliminates moving data between systems increasing performance data security\n",
    "### - enables data sceince functions on very large datasets, maintaining data security and privacy\n",
    "### - allows for deployment of analytics into NPS for high speed analyics \"in-place\" secured by operational IDs\n",
    "### The code here can be used with Aginity or any tool/application with a connection to NPS\n",
    "##\n",
    "### This is a collection of scripts notebooks, python, SQL for installing and using the analytics functions\n",
